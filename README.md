# Chess Blitz Slot Machine Game

Chess Blitz is a chess themed online slot machine game. The game has 5 reels and 3 rows, and the player can bet on up to 20 paylines. The symbols on the reels are the 12 chess pieces. The game also features a wild symbol that substitutes for all other symbols and triggers a wild free spins bonus, and a scatter symbol, which triggers the chessboard bonus game.

## Bonus Features

The game will feature two bonus modes:

- Wild Free Spins: When the player lands 3 or more wild symbols of any type, they trigger the wild free spins bonus round. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of wild symbols landed. During the free spins round, one of the 6 chess piece symbols is selected at random to become the special wild. All instances of wild symbols on the reels are boosted and create additional wild fields in the spaces the selected piece could make a chess move to.

- Chessboard Bonus Game: When the player lands 3 or more scatter symbols, they trigger the bonus game. In the bonus game, the player is presented with a chessboard and must select squares to reveal hidden prizes - if a player doesn't make a selection quickly a field is randomly selected for him. The game ends when the player selects a square that reveals the "RED FLAG" symbol or the "RED FLAG symbol" is revealed automatically. The sense of urgency is emphasized by a sound of a chess clock ticking, the bonus feature should emulate the feeling of playing a high stakes professional blitz chess game - the selections made being the "moves", the sound design should include crowd murmurs when low prizes are revealed and cheers when a big win is revealed.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
